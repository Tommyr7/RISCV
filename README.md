# RISCV

## Submission:

- git: https://github.com/Tommyr7/RISCV

- submission hash: 

## Design:

- 5-stage pipelined

- direct mapped i-cache ( $128\times(32+32)$ bits )

- basic branch prediction (1-bit)

## Performance:

- Running on FPGA

- frequency: 60MHz

- WNS: -0.324ns (too large when frequency is 100MHz)

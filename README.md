# RISCV

## Submission:

- git: https://github.com/Tommyr7/RISCV

- submission hash: 23b3ac8ef75038f9951f029d9b9ad25b61325ce5

## Design:

- 5-stage pipelined

- direct mapped i-cache (128*(32+32) bits)

- basic branch prediction (1-bit)

## Performance:

- Running on FPGA

- frequency: 60MHz

- WNS: -0.324ns (too large when frequency is 100MHz)
